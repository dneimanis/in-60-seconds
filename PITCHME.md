@css[text-bold text-25 text-smallcaps](Proxy) is a Conceptual design pattern that provides an object that acts as a substitute for a real service object used by a client. Proxy receives client requests, does some work (access control, caching, etc.) and then passes request to a service object.

@css[text-bold text-25 text-smallcaps](Lazy Loading) is a design pattern commonly used in computer programming to defer initialization of an object until the point at which it is needed.
